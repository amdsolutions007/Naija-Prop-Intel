# 🏠 Naija-Prop-Intel v0.1.0 - The Real Estate Scout

**First Release: AI-Powered Nigerian Real Estate Intelligence**

## 🎯 What's New

Nigeria's first AI property intelligence engine that saves buyers from:
- 🌊 Flood zones (July 2022 Lagos floods = 1,000+ properties destroyed)

- 📉 Bad investments (overpriced properties, low ROI)

## ✨ Core Features

### 1. Smart Risk Analysis
Weighted scoring: **Flood (40%) + Security (30%) + Infrastructure (30%)**

- Ajah: 42.5/100 (HIGH RISK) - ₦1.5M Omo Onile, 8hrs power, July 2022 flood

### 2. Investment ROI Calculator
5-year projection with hidden costs factored in

**Example:**
Lekki Phase 1 at ₦120M → 87% ROI over 5 years (EXCELLENT)
